# Mood-Log

[Hosted on Vercel](https://mood-log-navy.vercel.app/)

Created for [this](https://lemmy.dbzer0.com/c/DIYMentalHealth) mutual aid mental health and wellness community.

A PWA mood logging app based on a DBT diary card that only needs permission to keep your data in local storage with the option to export to a CSV for analysis. (I'm probably going to make a spreadsheet later with some sample views to help with Behavior Chain Analyses).

Current Bugs / Limitations:
- if you delete tag options you previously used then attempt to edit a previous entry without that tag as one of your options, it will (probably) erase that tag from your entry. And I'm not actually sure because I haven't specifically tested that.
- dunno how to get the white square to render properly when exported regardless of pasted text color
- if you don't put in a comment, it just pulls whatever the last column was whether thats a tag, the numerical mood value, or even the date.
Everybody wish me luck I'm a fucking healthcare worker and this is not a bedpan!
