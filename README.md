# Mood-Log
A PWA mood logging app based on a DBT diary card that only needs permission to keep your data in local storage with the option to export to a CSV for analysis. (I'm probably going to make a spreadsheet later with some sample views to help with Behavior Chain Analyses.

Right now I just have one basic functional HTML file that I need to figure out how to load into a PWA somehow everybody wish me luck I'm a fucking healthcare worker and this is not a bedpan!
