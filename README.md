# Mood-Log
A PWA mood logging app based on a DBT diary card that only needs permission to keep your data in local storage with the option to export to a CSV for analysis. (I'm probably going to make a spreadsheet later with some sample views to help with Behavior Chain Analyses.

Right now I just have one basic functional HTML file that I need to figure out how to load into a PWA somehow everybody wish me luck I'm a fucking healthcare worker and this is not a bedpan!

The biggest bug I'm currently aware of is that if you delete tag options you previously used then attempt to edit a previous entry without that tag as one of your options, it will (probably) erase that tag from your entry. And I'm not actually sure because I haven't specifically tested that.
